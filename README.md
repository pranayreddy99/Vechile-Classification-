# Vehicle-Classification-
Vehicle image classification using computer vision is a popular application of deep learning and machine learning techniques. The goal of this task is to automatically classify images of vehicles into different categories, such as cars, trucks, motorcycles, and buses

1.Data Collection: The first step in vehicle image classification is to gather and preprocess the data. This can include data such as images of different types of vehicles. The data can be collected from various sources, such as online repositories, image databases, or web scraping tools.

2.Data Exploration and Preparation: The collected data should be explored and prepared to ensure that it is ready for use in machine learning models. This can include steps such as data cleaning, image resizing, and normalization. Tools such as OpenCV and scikit-image can be used to process the data.

3.Model Selection: Once the data is processed, the next step is to select an appropriate machine learning model for vehicle image classification. Popular models for this task include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are widely used for image classification tasks. Models such as ResNet, InceptionNet and VGGNet are popular choices for vehicle image classification.

4.Model Training: After selecting the appropriate model, the next step is to train the model using the processed data. This can involve splitting the data into training and validation sets, tuning the hyperparameters of the model, and using techniques such as data augmentation to improve the performance of the model.

5.Model Evaluation: Once the model is trained, the next step is to evaluate its performance using a test set of images. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be used to evaluate the performance of the model.
